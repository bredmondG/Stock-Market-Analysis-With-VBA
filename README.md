# Stock-Market-Analysis-With-VBA
Analyzed stock market data using Visual Basic for Applications

* Created a script that will loop through one year of stock data for each run and return the total volume each stock had 
over that year. Displayed the ticker symbol to coincide with the total stock volume.
